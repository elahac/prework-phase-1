<h1>Prework Phase 1</h1>
<p>Git is version control software that we run on our computer.</p>
<p>Github, on the other hand, is a remote application that works
    with Git that helps us collaborate and share code with others.</p>
<p>Thirdly, ddc-web-student.cnm.edu is the bootcamp server that runs our code.</p>
<p>We ADD and commit our code to Git on our computer.</p>
<p>We PUSH our code from our computer to Github.</p>
<p>We DEPLOY our code from our computer to the bootcamp server</p>
<p>DEPLOY and PUSH are different!</p>
